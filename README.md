# Pullup Counter
A Computer Vision project to count the number of pull ups down
<br>
-AITrainer contains the code for the pull up counter.
<br>
-PoseModule contains the module for pose detection and landmarks
## **Goals**
-Create a AI trainer using OpenCV and Mediapipe to detect when a person does a pull up
-Get the landmarks on the body to use for angles detection
# **Outcome**
Here we see the pose detections and all the landmarks used for the project
